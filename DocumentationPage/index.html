                During 1842–1843 Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Francis Maneclang about Charles Babbage's newest
                proposed machine, the analytical engine; the notes included an appendix which specified in detail a method
                for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by some historians as the world's first computer
                program.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g., Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus
                in a formulaic way and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                To some people, some degree of expressive power and human-readability is required before the status of "programming language"
                is granted. Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple, extremely limited languages
                for describing the actions that these machines should perform.

                <em>JavaScript (JS)</em> is a lightweight, interpreted or JIT compiled programming language with first-class
                functions. Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use
                it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language,
                supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about
                JavaScript.

                The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1.
                Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major
                version of ECMAScript, ECMAScript 2015. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This
                documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2019. Do not confuse JavaScript
                with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks
                of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax,
                semantics, and uses.

                Becoming comfortable with JavaScript is a little harder than becoming comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start
                small and keep working in small consistent steps. To start, we'll show how to add some basic JavaScript to
                your page, creating a "hello world!" example
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, go to your test site and create a new folder named 'scripts' (without the quotes). Then, within the
                    new
                    <span class="distinct">scripts</span> folder you just created, create a new file called
                    <span class="distinct">main.js</span>. Save it in your scripts folder.</li>
                <li>
                    Next, in your
                    <span class="distinct">index.html</span> file enter the following element on a new line just before the closing
                    <span class="distinct">body </span>tag:
                    <code>
                        &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt; &lt; /script&gt;
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is basically doing the same job as the
                    <span class="distinct">link</span> element for CSS — it applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the
                    HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now add the following code to the
                    <span class="distinct">main.js</span> file:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
                            myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the var keyword, followed by
                any name you want to call it:
                <code>var myVariable;</code>
            </p>
            <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
                <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            </p>
            <p>You can do both these operations on the same line if you wish:
                <code>var myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            </p>
            <p>You can retrieve the value by just calling the variable by name:
                <code>myVariable;</code>
            </p>
            <p>After giving a variable a value, you can later choose to change it:
                <code>var myVariable = 'Bob'; myVariable = 'Steve';</code>
            </p>
            <p>You can also create messages concatenating the variables:
                <pre><code> var greeting = "Hello ";
                    var name = "Hipster ";
                    var message = greeting + name;
                    console.log(message);</code></pre>
            </p>

            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>
                Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. When you need the procedure you can call a function,
                with the function name, instead of rewriting the entire code each time. You have already seen some uses of
                functions above, for example:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <code>var myVariable = document.
                            <span class="red-span">querySelector</span>('h1');</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            <span class="red-span">alert</span>('hello!');</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                These functions,
                <span class="distinct">document.querySelector</span> and
                <span class="distinct">alert</span>, are built into the browser for you to use whenever you desire.
            </p>
            <p>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but has parentheses —
                <span class="distinct">()</span> — after it, it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments — bits of data they need to
                do their job. These go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</p>
            <p>For example, the
                <span class="distinct">alert()</span> function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string
                as an argument to tell the function what to write in the pop-up box.</p>
            <p>The good news is you can define your own functions — in this next example we write a simple function which takes
                two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        function <span class="red-span">multiply</span>(num1,num2) { 
                            var result = num1 * num2;
                            return result; 
                            }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>Try running the above function in the console, then test with several arguments. For example:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        <span class="red-span">multiply</span>(4,7);
                        
                        <span class="red-span">multiply</span>(20,20);
                        
                        <span class="red-span">multiply</span>(0.5,3);
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <hr>

        <section id="if_statement" class="main-section ">
            <header>if Statement</header>
            <p>
                While writing a program, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one out of a given set of paths. In such cases,
                you need to use conditional statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right
                actions. JavaScript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on
                different conditions. Here we will explain the if..else statement.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript supports the following forms of if..else statement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>if statement</li>
                <li>if...else statement</li>
                <li>if...else if... statement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The
                <span class="distinct">if</span> statement is the fundamental control statement that allows JavaScript to make decisions and execute
                statements conditionally.</p>
            <h4>Syntax</h4>
            <p>The syntax for a basic if statement is as follows:
                <pre><code>
                        if (expression){
                            Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
                         }
                </code></pre> </p>
            <p>Here a JavaScript expression is evaluated. If the resulting value is true, the given statement(s) are executed.
                If the expression is false, then no statement would be not executed. Most of the times, you will use comparison
                operators while making decisions.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Try the following example to understand how the if statement works.</p>
            <pre><code>
                        &lt;html&gt;
                            &lt;body&gt;
                                   
                                        &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
                                      
                                         var age = 20;
                                      
                                         if( age > 18 ){

                                            document.write("<b>Qualifies for driving</b>");

                                         }
                                      
                                      &lt;/script&gt;
                                   
                                    &lt;p&gt;Set the variable to different value and then try...&lt;/p&gt;
                                 &lt;/body&gt;
                           &lt;/html&gt;
                </code></pre>
            <h3>if...else Statement</h3>
            <p>The 'if...else' statement is the next form of control statement that allows JavaScript to execute statements
                in a more controlled way.</p>
            <pre><code>
                        if (expression){
                            Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
                         }
                         
                         else{
                            Statement(s) to be executed if expression is false
                         }
                </code></pre>
            <p>Here JavaScript expression is evaluated. If the resulting value is true, the given statement(s) in the ‘if’ block,
                are executed. If the expression is false, then the given statement(s) in the else block are executed.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <pre><code>
                            &lt;html&gt;

            <p>The syntax of an if-else-if statement is as follows</p>
            <pre><code>
                        if (expression 1){
                            Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
                         }
                         
                         else if (expression 2){
                            Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
                         }
                         
                         else if (expression 3){
                            Statement(s) to be executed if expression 3 is true
                         }
                         
                         else{
                            Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true
                         }
                </code></pre>
            <p>There is nothing special about this code. It is just a series of
                <span class="distinct">if</span> statements, where each
                <span class="distinct">if</span> is a part of the
                <span class="distinct">else</span> clause of the previous statement. Statement(s) are executed based on the true condition, if none
                of the conditions is true, then the
                <span class="distinct">else</span> block is executed.</p>
